# Specification Quality Checklist: Qdrant Embeddings Ingestion Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All checklist items pass. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: core ingestion, P2: error handling, P3: metadata enrichment)
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on measurable outcomes
- Well-defined scope with explicit "out of scope" items
- Assumptions documented for context

**No Issues Found**: Specification adheres to all quality guidelines and is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
