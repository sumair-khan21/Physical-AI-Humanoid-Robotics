## Chapter Purpose & Audience

Guide readers through installing and configuring ROS 2 Humble or Iron on Ubuntu 22.04, setting up a development workspace, and verifying the installation with basic commands.

**Target Audience**: Developers setting up their first ROS 2 environment.

---

## Learning Objectives

1. Install ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04 using official Debian packages
2. Configure the ROS 2 environment variables and shell setup
3. Create and build a ROS 2 workspace using colcon
4. Verify installation by running demo nodes and viewing communication
5. Troubleshoot common installation issues (missing dependencies, path errors)

---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 installed (physical machine, VM, or WSL2)
- Completed Chapter 1 (understand ROS 2 concepts)
- Sudo/admin access to install packages

---

## Key Concepts

**TODO**: Add content from spec.md lines 279-286:
- ROS 2 distributions: Humble (LTS), Iron (latest), and their support timelines
- Installation methods: Debian packages (recommended) vs. building from source
- Environment setup: sourcing setup.bash, ROS_DOMAIN_ID, ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY
- Workspaces: overlay vs. underlay, workspace structure (src/, build/, install/, log/)
- colcon build tool for compiling ROS 2 packages
- Dependency management: rosdep for installing system dependencies

---

## Installation Steps

**TODO**: Add detailed installation process from spec.md lines 288-325

### Step 1: System Update

```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Add ROS 2 Repository

**TODO**: Add repository setup commands

### Step 3: Install ROS 2 Humble

```bash
# Install ROS 2 Humble (Desktop variant)
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

### Step 4: Environment Setup

```bash
# Source ROS 2 setup file
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Add to .bashrc for automatic sourcing
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Creating Your First Workspace

**TODO**: Add workspace creation guide from spec.md

```bash
# Create workspace directory
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws

# Build workspace
colcon build

# Source the workspace
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

---

## Diagrams / Architecture Notes

**TODO**: Add Mermaid.js diagrams from spec.md lines 327-331:
- Workspace Structure Diagram
- Environment Layering Diagram
- Installation Verification Flowchart

---

## Verification

**TODO**: Add verification steps from spec.md

### Running Demo Nodes

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run talker
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

# Terminal 2: Run listener
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**TODO**: Add common issues and solutions from spec.md lines 293-294

---

## Practice Tasks

**TODO**: Add practice tasks from spec.md lines 333-338:
- Task 1: Install ROS 2 Humble
- Task 2: Create and build workspace
- Task 3: Run demo nodes
- Task 4: Configure automatic environment setup

---

## Summary

**TODO**: Add summary points from spec.md lines 340-348

---
