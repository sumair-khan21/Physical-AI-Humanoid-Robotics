# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, a comprehensive textbook designed to guide you through the exciting world of humanoid robotics, from foundational concepts to advanced AI integration.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook provides hands-on, practical guidance across five major modules:

### 📚 Module 1: ROS 2 Foundations
Master the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the industry-standard framework for robotics development. You'll learn:
- ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Setting up ROS 2 on Ubuntu 22.04
- Topics, services, and actions
- URDF modeling for humanoid robots

### 🎮 Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation
Explore simulation technologies for safe, cost-effective robot development:
- Simulation fundamentals and digital twins
- Gazebo for physics-based simulation
- Unity for high-fidelity visualization

### 🚀 Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac
Dive into GPU-accelerated robotics simulation and AI:
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim overview
- Visual SLAM and perception
- Navigation and path planning

### 🤖 Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrate AI and natural language understanding with robotics:
- Voice-to-action systems
- LLM-based task planning
- Multimodal robotics (vision + language + action)

### 🎯 Capstone: System Integration
Bring it all together in a comprehensive project:
- System architecture design
- Sim-to-real transfer strategies
- Complete demo implementation

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this textbook, you should have:
- **Basic Linux familiarity**: Comfortable with command-line operations
- **Programming knowledge**: Experience with Python or C++ is helpful
- **Ubuntu 22.04**: Access to Ubuntu (physical machine, VM, or WSL)
- **Curiosity and persistence**: Robotics is complex but incredibly rewarding!

## How to Use This Textbook

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:
1. **Learning Objectives**: Clear, measurable goals
2. **Prerequisites**: What you need to know before starting
3. **Core Concepts**: Foundational theory and explanations
4. **Examples**: Real-world use cases and demonstrations
5. **Practice Tasks**: Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
6. **Summary**: Key takeaways
7. **References**: Official documentation for deeper exploration

:::tip Start with Module 1
If you're new to ROS 2, begin with **Module 1: ROS 2 Foundations**. The modules build on each other, so a solid understanding of ROS 2 is essential for success in later chapters.
